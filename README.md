## What's Ambience?
Ambience is a minimalistic puzzle/orientation game made by Justin "Ayes" Schildt from germany. It's goal is simply said to reach the goal which is a white vortex
located somwhere in the level. On your way you may encounter walls and other threats that block your path. Can you still make it?
